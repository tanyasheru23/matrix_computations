#Methods of Solving System of Linear Equations using matrix computational theory
There are different methods to solve the liner system.
Here are few of them implemented from scratch in Python

1. Jacobian Method
2. SOR Method
3. Guass Seidel Method
   <br>
   The functions for the above methods are listed in the linearSystemMethods folder.
   And the plots folder consists of the plots of results from main.py
